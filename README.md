University Domains Collector
============================


I couldn't find a list of universities of the world and their domains. So i decided to make a scraper for this.

This can be very useful if you are planning to make a service for university students.

This is very simple scrapper that generates a json file that contains necessary information.

Usage
=====

Make sure that requests, lxml and beautifulsoup is installed.

```bash

python collector.py

```


Output
======

The output file can be found [here](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list).
